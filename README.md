# Alfred-Warp-wd-Workflow
An Alfred Workflow for using the [great zsh-tool "wd"](https://github.com/mfaerevaag/wd) directly in your search box!

The workflow uses a very simple python script for reading out the wd config and showing the paths in the alfred seach bar.
The texts are in german, but it should be easy to adapt them as you like.

Thanks to @mfaerevaag and @altschuler for saving hours of my live and thanks to [@twitter/twemoji](https://github.com/twitter/twemoji) for the icon!

## Contributing:
While I think the workflow does the job, which it was written for, quite good, I'm always open to new ideas and/or pull requests & issues!
